# 🧪 SauceDemo Automation Testing Project

This project automates end-to-end functional testing for the [**SauceDemo**](https://www.saucedemo.com/) website using **Selenium WebDriver**, **Java**, and **TestNG**.  
It covers major modules such as Login, Inventory, Cart, Checkout, Logout, and additional UX, Negative, and Security test cases.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to simulate real-world QA automation practices by testing critical workflows on the SauceDemo web application — a demo e-commerce site used for UI automation training.  

The framework is designed with a **modular structure** for maintainability and follows:
- Page Object Model (POM)
- TestNG annotations (`@BeforeMethod`, `@Test`, `@AfterMethod`)
- Assertion-based validations
- Explicit waits and WebDriverManager integration
